An android application intends to track Emergency Response Vehicles (ERV)like ambulances, firetrucks etc. 

## how it works

The application has two modules. One for the general population and other for the ERV drivers. 

### ERV module
As soon the driver is out on the trip all he has to do start the application and thats it. "Click" will start broadcasting vehicles' realtime location. [Thanks to Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/).

### General Module

The app is continuously listning to the any broadcasts. As soon as the ERV enters the 3KM diameter of current position of the user, it will notify the user. As simple as that.
